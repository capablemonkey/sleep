        <h1>"shit.  what time did I fall asleep?"</h1>

<h3>The answer to this often hopeless question is actually right under your nose.</h3>
<h3>What if you could know when your laptop went to sleep, either because it got bored of waiting for your input, or you slammed the lid in a fit of tired rage?</h3>

  <h2>what?</h2>
  <p><b>Sleep</b> is a little node-webkit application for Mac OS X that lives in your status bar. It was created in an attempt to answer the ancient question of "ugh, when did I fall asleep last night?" by telling you when your MacBook went to sleep, presumably because you closed the lid, or because it was idle for a while.  As someone who often finds myself waking up on the couch with my laptop on my chest, lid closed, this is handy for determining whether or not I got enough sleep the night before (increasingly often, the answer is no).</p>

  <p>I had a lot of fun building this, and learned a ton about node-webkit (now called nw.js).  Take a look at the source if you'd like!</p>
